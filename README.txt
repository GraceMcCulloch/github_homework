Hi, I am a Masters Student at the University of New Hampshire pursuing a degree in Natural Resources: Wildlife and Conservation Biology. 
I am broadly interested in wildlife biology, with a specific focus on the conservation of birds, wildlife population dynamics, and habitat associations.
My current research focuses on understanding the habitat associations of the vulnerrable saltmarsh sparrow (Ammospiza caudacuta) and other tidal marsh birds in NH.
